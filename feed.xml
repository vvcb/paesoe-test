    &lt;p&gt;Tadiwos Utalo BSc,MSc is an Integrated Emergency Surgery Officer based at Bele Primary Hospital, in the rural part of Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
The nearest referral hospital is 45 KM away.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;i-mail&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tady.2001.tu@gmail.com &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;i-phone&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 0960213136&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-report&quot;&gt;Case Report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 35 years old mother, P=V A=0, lactating a one-year old male child, presented to Bele Primary Hospital with a chief complaint of severe and intermittent crampy lower abdominal pain.
She also complained of abdominal swelling, nausea, and constipation. 
Her symptoms had started 7 days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother was illiterate and married to a farmer with a low income for the last 20 years.
Her menstrual history was irregular but had used contraceptives in the form of Depo injections 3 xs before one year.
She had a long inter-pregnancy period of 15 years before the delivery of her last child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was treated with intravenous antibiotics at her local health center.
But, with no improvement she was referred to our Hospital with the diagnosis of &lt;em&gt;Acute Abdomen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clinical-examination&quot;&gt;Clinical Examination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On presentation, she was acutely unwell and looking ill.
She was not pale, not icteric and had wet bucal mucosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had a pulse rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 100/60, respiratory rate of 26bpm and temperature of 37.1 degree celsius.
No respiratory or cardiovascular abnormality was detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abdominal examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had a distended abdomen which moved respiration, no old abdominal scar, no visible peristaltic bowel movement and normoactive bowel sounds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On palpation, there was a large intra abdominal mass which was smooth, round bordered, slightly mobile, advanced beyond umblical region and severely tender
No palpable fetal poles. 
Dullness was present over the anterior margin of the intra abdominal mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital rectal examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No palpable rectal mass, no PR bleeding or impacted fecal matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genito-urinary examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cervix closed, no blood on examining finger, no cervical motion tenderness. 
Normal non gravid uterus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lab-investigations&quot;&gt;Lab investigations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haematocrit: 35%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HCG Urine Test: Negative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete Blood Count, Biochemistry and Sonography are not currently available at Bele hospital.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;management&quot;&gt;Management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acute abdomen likely secondary to Ovarian Cyst Torsion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preoperative preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was resuscitated with crystalloids, an NG tube was inserted  and broad spectrum IV antibiotics were administered.
Informed written signed consent for Emergency Explorative laparotomy was obtained after counselling her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot; kramdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2019-03-04-ieso-surgical-team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tadiwos Utalo operating with his team at Bele Hospital&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot; kramdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2019-03-04-case-ovarian-torsion-intraop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tadiwos Utalo operating on adnexal torsion at Bele Hospital&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under general anaesthesia with endotracheal integration, emergency laparotomy was performed via a vertical midline incision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large ovarian cyst had caused left adnexal torsion resulting in a very ischemic left ovary and dark and edematous left adnexa pedicles.
The adnexal mass had twisted anti-clockwise 4 times (4x).
The right adnexa, uterus, bladder and bowel were healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detorsion or untwisting of the ischemic left ovarian mass and edematous fallopian tube was attempted to check for viability. With no evidence of viability, a left Salpingo-oopherectomy was performed to remove severely ischemic left adnexal torsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;postoperative-outcome&quot;&gt;Postoperative Outcome&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged home after 5 days in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot; kramdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the entire team at Bele Hospital including the anaesthetist, ward nurses, theatre staff as well as the administrative staff, this patient has had a good outcome and is very grateful for the care she received.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAESOE at 2019 ESOG Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PAESOE President, Mr. Melese Takele was invited as a panelist at the 27th Annual Conference of the Ethiopian Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (&lt;a href=&quot;http://esog-eth.org&quot;&gt;ESOG&lt;/a&gt;) and shared his thoughts on the role of IESOs and PAESOE in improving universal access to Primary Health Care and the safety of obstetric practice. A summary of his comments at the conference are presented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-paesoe-see-the-challenges-faced-with-universal-access-to-primary-health-care-and-the-safety-of-obstetric-practice&quot;&gt;How does PAESOE see the challenges faced with universal access to Primary Health Care and the safety of Obstetric practice?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary Health Care (PHC) is essential health care made universally accessible to every individual.
It must be acceptable to the community and is implemented with the full participation of the community.
It has to be delivered at a cost that the community and country can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Primary Health Care is the first point of contact within a multi-tier healthcare system and is available at community, health center and primary hospital levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The majority of primary health care for surgery and obstetrics is provided by integrated emergency surgical officer (&lt;em&gt;IESO&lt;/em&gt;) professionals at these centres.
Therefore, any discussion regarding improving universal access to PHC and safety of obstetric practice has to addresss the role or performance of existing as well as new IESOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universal access to PHC, particularly reproductive health services, is an important goal of every country around the world.
Ethiopia is one of the countries striving to achieve the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/memberstates/ethiopia&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; set by United Nations by improving access to emergency obstetric care and life saving surgical services to the most vulnerable communities.
Over the past few years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moh.gov.et/&quot;&gt;Ethiopian MoH&lt;/a&gt; has implemented many activities including constructing new health facilities, availing basic supplies and producing/introducing new task force including Health Extension Workers to address health extension packages and IESOs to increase the access to emergency obstetric and surgical services).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;achievements-of-iesos-and-paesoe&quot;&gt;Achievements of IESOs and PAESOE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have over 730 IESOs who have graduated from 11 universities and have been posted to most rural hospitals to improve access and quality of PHC.
The deployment of these professionals has resulted in significant changes on the accessibility/quality of emergency obstetric and surgical care that is available to communities who are in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In just 5-7 years since deployment of IESOs, maternal mortality rate in Ethiopia has dropped from 676 per 100,000 births in 2011 (2011 EDHS report) to 353 per 100,000 (MoH report).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s establishment, PAESOE has been enganged in various activities to further support and improve the good work already being done by our member IESOs.
These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working closely to address IESO’s issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;liasing with MOH and other organisations regarding future career development and incentive packages for IESOs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;establishing a standard on IESO’s in private practice and others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;with strong support of Dr. Biku Ghosh and Dr. Vishnu Chandrabalan from UK, we have already created a website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://paesoe.org&quot;&gt;https://paesoe.org&lt;/a&gt;) to update our association members and others about the organisation’s activities, upcoming training workshops, as well as provide links to useful elearning resources such as textbooks, journals, videos, guidelines and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have also been working to facilitate training for IESO professionals (after having strong communication with Prof Staffan from Karolinska Institute-Gotland, course has been moved to Ethiopia, last year given at Bahrdar University).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all these achievements, still there are numerous challenges that ESO professionals are facing on the provision of Obstetric and surgical emergency services to community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At community level:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;delays and poor health seeking behavior&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;poor awareness on the services that are available in near by facilities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At health facility level:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;shortage of supplies within the facilities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;frequent turnover of professionals from site of deployment ( esp anesthetist)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;no functional blood banks&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;poor staff satisfaction due to unsatisfactory incentive packages, poor administration within the hospitals, absence/delay of career progression.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;skills gap due to unavailability of CME program and supportive supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At higher level (country or global):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;mostly related with financial constraints&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;problem of evidence based policy formulation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthen the leadership system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work to sort out issues that can dissatisfied the staffs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evidence based policy formulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increase the domestic finance to Primary Health Care instead of investing more budget to secondary or teritiary level of care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn from other countries having best experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposals-on-maintaining-quality-of-obstetric-care-and-the-way-forward-in-primary-health-care&quot;&gt;Proposals on maintaining quality of obstetric care and the way forward in Primary Health Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain the quality of emergency obstetrics and surgical care, PAESOE has planned to do in the future either independently or together with MoH and other societies like ESOG, SSE, and midwife association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To have regular and structured CME programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular audits of key performance indicators to be decided by MOH /ESOG/PAESOE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular morbidity and mortality reports to enable continued improvement (but this should be within a ‘no-blame’ culture).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure minimum criteria for equipment and staffing are met in all health centres.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve access to elearning resources including training videos, courses so that we can continue improving every day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create distance-learning, online courses in safe obstetric care to support career progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-10-11-southern-region-annual-meeting-report-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of delegates at PAESOE Southern Region Annual meeting in October, 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Activities carried out were,&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Overall regional clinical activities were presented by Mr.Shimelis Tesfaye (Regional PAESOE coordinator) by which he mentioned that a total of 120,000 Emergency life saving Surgical procedures were performed over a year.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Clinical scientific papers were presented by members&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Dr.Abrham Alano ( SNNPR health bureau Head) Said that we can’t replace IESOs by any other professionals that it is not because they save lives doing Emergency Surgery but committed to stay at stressful work area all the time need, very compassionate and comparable less complication to senior physicians.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-10-11-southern-region-annual-meeting-report-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of delegates at PAESOE Southern Region Annual meeting in October, 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Finally, IESOs raised issues to higher officials like&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Protracted Educational career development&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Less salary &amp;amp; incentives&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Poor hospital setup to practice all their skills, shortage of blood &amp;amp; Medical equipment &amp;amp; responded accordingly.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-introduction&quot;&gt;1.0 Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different studies were conducted and have agreed the deployment of ESOs in all health facilities (Primary and General Hospitals) has resulted in remarkable increase in volume of MNH and emergency surgical services with improvement in maternal and perinatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of ESOs are working in rural hospital where there are limited newborn care services and no trained isolated health professionals for new born babies. 
They are also responsible to help and coach midwives in resuscitating and evaluating the babies. 
So boosting their capacity on neonatal resuscitation and newborn evaluation is the paramount important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding this, professional association for emergency surgical officers of Ethiopia in collaboration with UNFPA took the initiative to conduct two days refreshment training for 25 IESOs, held on 28^th^ and 29^th^ of October, 2017 in Embilta Hotel, Addis Ababa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the training was to equip ESOs with advanced neonatal resuscitation skills using basic equipment and to enhance their knowledge on newborn evaluation before referral to the best set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning objectives of the participants were that;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate an understanding of the physiology asphyxia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assess the new born at birth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform resuscitation of new born using basic equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;20-activities&quot;&gt;2.0 Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities included;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oral Presentations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Illustration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return Demonstration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feedback from the participants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;30-pre-test&quot;&gt;3.0 Pre-test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre – test included basic questions on initial assessment of the new born, immediate care of the new born and resuscitation techniques.
The highest score was 91% while the lowest scored 68% with an average score of 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;40-presentations&quot;&gt;4.0 Presentations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first presentation covered; an overview on neonatal deaths, neonatal asphyxia, and risk factors of neonatal asphyxia, initial assessment at birth and airway management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second presentation covered the equipment used in neonatal resuscitation and steps of neonatal resuscitation, and new born evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-10-29-neonatal-resus-training-report-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of delegates at training&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-10-29-neonatal-resus-training-report-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of delegates at training&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;50-demonstration&quot;&gt;5.0 Demonstration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were divided into four groups and allocated different resuscitation stations. 
The facilitator demonstrated the steps of neonatal resuscitation and there was a return demonstration from each of the participants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-10-29-neonatal-resus-training-report-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of delegates at training&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants during the practical session&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;60-post-test&quot;&gt;6.0 Post Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same test was done to compare the performance of the participants before and after the training.
For the post-test a highest score of 97% and lowest 76% with an average of 86.5% were obtained. 
Health workers were asked which neonatal resuscitation equipment they had and among 20 facilities only 13 facilities had 50 % or more of the basic required equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;70-achievements&quot;&gt;7.0 Achievements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bringing all ESOs together enabled us to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have received positive feedback from the health facilities where the participants came from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was an increase in knowledge of the neonatal resuscitation process at the end of the training as shown in the scores from the post-test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;80-recommendations&quot;&gt;8.0 Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The TOT training should be considered for Emergency surgical officers to conduct institutional based /on job training for all midwives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trainees should disseminate what they have learned to fellow health workers in respective health facilities through CME sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For midwives working in hospitals, such training should be incorporated in their Continuous Medical Education (CME) sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Birth attendants in clinics, in the community need to be attached to health facilities that conduct regular CME sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;90-feedback-from-participants&quot;&gt;9.0 Feedback from participants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;91-lessons-learned&quot;&gt;9.1 Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proper steps in resuscitation (positioning, when to stop, when to start compressions and suctioning)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pathophysiology of asphyxia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What to do during cardiopulmonary resuscitation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making the operating room ready with the resuscitation table&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preparing the baby for resuscitation (drying, tilting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to use resuscitation equipment (Ambu bag, bulb)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to properly evaluate the newborns before referral&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Importance of immediate referral to Hospital if resuscitation fails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use of Stethoscope in monitoring heart rate during resuscitation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Importance of skin to skin contact after birth of a baby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resuscitation of mothers, and neonates with asphyxia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appearance of a premature baby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping the baby warm after birth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;92-suggested-topics-for-further-training&quot;&gt;9.2 Suggested topics for further training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advance neonatal resuscitation training or TOT training&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Saving lives by task sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A survey published in the African Journal of Midwifery and Women’s Health (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajmw&quot;&gt;AJM&lt;/a&gt;) showed that IESO’s had carried out a total of 20 176 caesarean sections since graduating with low postoperative complications and mortality.
The authors concluded that task-sharing with trained non-doctor emergency surgeons can improve access and outcomes for patients in need of essential surgical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia has serious shortages of obstetric and surgical specialists.
A national Masters degree programme to train non-doctor mid-level health professionals in Emergency Surgery and Obstetrics started in 2009.
Qualified professionals are known as integrated emergency surgical officers (IESOs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aims&quot;&gt;Aims&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was carried out to evaluate graduated IESO's performances and the outcome of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires were sent to all 135 registered members of the Professional Association of Emergency Surgical Officers of Ethiopia (PAESOE).
Responses were received from 64 IESOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that the IESOs had carried out a total of 20 176 caesarean sections since graduating.
In the first 3 months of 2016, there were 3035 caesarean sections and 970 other laparotomies.
Following caesarean section, the rate of neonatal deaths was 2.8%, and the rate of maternal deaths was 0.26%.
The rate of maternal deaths following laparotomies was 0.61%.
The rate of postoperative complications was 1.92%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that task-sharing with trained non-doctor emergency surgeons can improve access and outcomes for patients in need of essential surgical care.
A similar programme could be a model for other developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theme of the year, which can perfectly represent the mission , vision and goal of the association&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues related to strengthen the association membership, as it is known that around 680 ISO’s deployed by FMoH and these are actively working in different corner of Ethiopia but among these around 215 have been registered as a member of PAESOE.
One participant who came from Oromia Regional state said “unity is strength and being a member is all about the existence of the association since the last year (2016) , right now it is for the benefit of every health professional(IESOs) him/her self”.
Because every benefits which is coming from the association should directly will go for those who are full member and participating actively.
Supporting idea were forwarded from Tigray, Amhara, Afar, Somalia, Benishangul Gumuz , Addis Ababa And Dire Dawa IESO representatives.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;how to strengthening the association office in terms of financial and human resources.
Among the invited distinguished guests, Dr.Awoke from UNFPA made a speech and explained about the trend of maternal mortality which has dramatically been reduced to 420 /100000 and mentioned that how the idea of task shifting and sharing have been well implemented and have come the truth as IESO is the benchmark in reducing maternal death in Ethiopia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having tea break, one of the keynote speaker from WHO was Dr Haimanot Ambelu explained that on the good performance of IESO, what has been achieved so far after deployment of this task shifted cadres in rural areas of the country , and she reassured that WHO Ethiopia ia alway willing to work with the association.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Case Reports from Ethiopia</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;penetrating-abdominal-trauma&quot;&gt;Penetrating abdominal trauma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 29 year-old man was admitted to Sekota hospital on Febuary 2, 2014 after suffering a serious injury.
The man was stabbed during a violent fight and was left in a state of shock (BP 80/40mmhg and PR 126 bpm).
After abdominal examination, it was concluded that he had a 2 cm by 2 cm deep wound on the subumbilical area.
There was eviscerated bowel and the area was soiled with fecal content.
Fortunately, it was viable (not ischemic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the diagnosis of the penetrating abdominal trauma, the area 2 degrees to the stab injury was eviscerated.  Meanwhile resuscitation and the baseline investigation were sent to the labotatory.
The patient was taken to OR and a laparotomy was conducted.
The intraoperative finding was a 1 cm by 1cm two site bowel perforation at its mesentdric border.
The site of perforations was repaired using two layers and cleaning the peritonium.
Haematocrit was 18% so one unit of blood intraoperatively and one unit post operatively was given.
IV antibiotic was started after 7 days.
The patient finally reached a stable condition and was discharged from hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016-10-25-stories-from-ethiopia-trauma-laparotomy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of surgeon, assistant and anaesthetist during a trauma laparotomy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ruptured-uterus-saved-by-non-doctor-surgeons&quot;&gt;Ruptured uterus saved by non-doctor surgeons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 34 year-old woman, gravida 5 para 4, was admitted to the hospital after complaining of a pushing down sesnsation.
She suffered these sensations for a duration of 2 days. [and passage of liquor 1 day duration] She has no history of an ANC follow up.
After examination of the patient it was concluded that the BP was unrecordable, the pulse rate was weak and feeble, she had dry lips and buccal mucosa and a pale conjuctiva.
After abdominal examination it was concluded that she had grossly distended abdomen and a severe tenderness.
There was an easly palpable fetal part, however obstetric ultrasound results showed that a FHB was not present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After diagnosis of the uterine rupture 2 degrees to the obstructed labour, a two line IV was secured and fluid resuscitation continued.
Then a catheter was inserted and two units of cross matched blood were prepared.
Afterwards, the patient was taken to OR and a laparotomy was conducted.
After the sugery a gross hemoperitonium  and dead fetus floating in the peritonium were found.
The uterus was ruptured at its lower segment extending to the left lateral.
After the removal of the dead fetus and hemoperitonium, a total abdominal hysterectomy was executed.
After the operation, the patient was totaly transfused 3 units of blood and was covered by IV antibiotics.
The patient’s condition became progressive and she was discharged after 7 days in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IESOs praised in Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In an article published in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ejhs/index&quot;&gt;Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, 
the authors praise the clinical decision making and surgical skills of ESOs and their impact on improving access to emergency surgery to the population. IESOs performed 94% of 4075 emergency surgeries performed between 2012 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious shortage of gynecologists and surgeons for several decades leading to a three year masters level training was initiated in 2009.
However, systematic analysis was not done to assess the graduates’ performance.
The purpose of this study was to assess improvement in access to emergency surgical and obstetrical care services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to assess the competence of emergency surgical officers (ESOs) in their decision making and surgical skills in eight hospitals between 2012 and 2014.
Anesthesia time, post-operative hospital stay and change in hemoglobin level were, among others, used as proxy indicators of their surgical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 4075 obstetric and surgical operations was performed in the study hospitals.
Of which, 93% were done on emergency base.
Of the total emergency procedures, 3570(94%) were done by ESOs.
Nearly two-thirds (63%) of all the emergency operations were cesarean sections, which were done by ESOs.
Out of 239 uterine ruptures, hysterectomy was done for 58%.
The proportion of cesarean and instrumental deliveries over the total deliveries were 13% and 0.7%, respectively.
Explorative laparotomies and appendectomies were the majority of the non-obstetric emergency operations.
Interviewed staff in the respective hospitals stated that ESOs’ clinical decision making, surgical skill and commitment to discharge their responsibilities were in the best possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study showed that deployment of ESOs made the emergency surgery services accessible to the majority, and their clinical decision making and surgical skills were remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ESOG-led Performance Assessment of IESOs</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-75&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ethiopian society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists &lt;a href=&quot;http://esog-eth.org&quot;&gt;(ESOG)&lt;/a&gt; led and fully supported an assessment of the services provided by IESOs as part of its objective to support and promote quality reproductive health services in the country.
It believes that the findings of this assessment will be highly useful to reflect on and improve the IESO programme of the country.
The findings ultimately will help improve the quality of C-EmONC and Emergency Surgical Services provided in health facilities where ESOs are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-and-rationale&quot;&gt;Background and rationale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia was committed to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.
These included the MDG 4 and 5 aiming to reduce child mortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three quarters by 2015 from the 1990 levels.
To achieve these targets, the government with its partners has been intensifying its efforts to strengthen health care services planning to construct many hospitals and train adequate skilled clinical staff that can provide comprehensive emergency obstetric &amp;amp; newborn care (CEmONC) services as well as emergency surgical services.
One of the major initiatives designed by the F-MOH in 2009 was Integrated Emergency Surgical Officers (IESO) initiative which is a Master of Science (MsC) training program.
The goal of the MSc training programme is to produce competent Emergency Surgical Officers (ESO) capable to handle common emergency obstetric-gynaecological and emergency general surgical procedures including trauma where a gynaecologist and a surgeon are inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESOs are deployed in several health facilities in different regions of the country since 2012 to provide CEmONC and emergency surgical services.
As the deployment of ESOs at health facilities to provide these services is a new experience in the country, conducting the program assessment is reasonable and of paramount importance.
In addition, it is to comply with the WHO and global recommendation of careful monitoring of task shifting approaches in health care service delivery like the IESO program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;objective&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general objective of the assessment is to provide an in-depth facility level performance assessment of CEmONC and emergency surgical services provided by emergency surgical officers and inform the different stakeholders for quality improvement of the service provided and the IESO program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;materials-and-methods&quot;&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a facility based descriptive cross-sectional assessment.
It was conducted by ESOG in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health, CDC-Ethiopia, Regional Health Offices, target facilities and other stakeholders.
The inclusion criterion was all facilities where ESO’s have been deployed for at least one year before the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data was collected in two rounds between July and December, 2015. 
Data was collected using a data collection format prepared for the purpose by the F-MOH through interviews, discussions with facility staff, a review of patient’s medical records &amp;amp; registers.
To facilitate the data collection process and avoid the critical shortage of high level health care providers required for the data collection; the target regions were grouped in to four groups based on geographic proximity and data was collected in four rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collector teams conducted the data collection with site visit staying at each facility for 3 - 5 days.
All the collected data were coded.
Both individual and facility level data were then entered, cleaned and analyzed using SPSS Version 20.0 statistical software.
Ethical clearance was obtained from Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) and Centres for Disease Control (CDC) before data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data was collected from a total of 96 facilities from 8 regions of the country.
About two third of the facilities, 66% (63/96), were primary hospitals.
A total of 205 ESOs were deployed and practicing in the facilities with an average of about two ESOs per facility.
In the majority of the facilities, 58.3% (56/96), ESOs were practicing in facilities where neither Obstetricians nor Surgeons were deployed (ESO-Only facilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majority, 65.6% (63/96), of the facilities were providing regularly all the 9 signal functions in the 12 months period prior to the facility visit.
Two of the facilities never started providing major surgical services although the ESOs were deployed for more than one year prior to the visit.
Blood transfusion was the commonest essential service not provided regularly.
It was not provided regularly in 32% (18/56) and 12.5% (5/40) of ESO-Only and ESO-Plus facilities respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of MNH and emergency surgical services showed remarkable increment in the year after the deployment of ESOs.
The total number of deliveries increased by 40 % compared to the year before ESOs deployment.
The increase in the number of deliveries in ESO-only facilities was about twice that of ESO-Plus facilities with 61% and 30% increases respectively.
The number of instrument assisted and caesarean deliveries also increased by 39% and 59% respectively.
Non-emergency surgical procedures increased by 162% in ESO-Only facilities raising a concern for patient safety and quality of care as ESOs scope of work doesn’t include major elective surgical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of intra-facility maternal deaths per total deliveries in the facilities decreased by 38.2% in the year after ESOs deployment.
The decrease in ESO-plus facilities (39.1%) was higher than that of ESO-Only facilities (29.7%).
There was similarly a remarkable reduction in proportion of early neonatal deaths in ESO only facilities (34.2%) as compared to ESO plus facilities (6.9%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excessive blood loss and deep incision extension were the commonest documented complications in cases being managed by the ESOs in both groups of facilities with proportions of 35.6% (48/135) and 20.7% (28/135) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 170 maternal deaths from the 63 facilities (32 ESO-Only &amp;amp; 31 ESO-Plus) were reviewed.
Hypovolemic shock secondary to excessive bleeding was the commonest stated cause of maternal deaths being responsible for 58.5% (79/135) of the deaths.
Patient delay to reach the facility was the major contributor for the maternal death in majority, 63.8% (83/130), of cases in both groups of facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern of change for volume of emergency surgical services provided in the facilities was mostly similar to that of MNH services.
Shortage of equipments and supplies required for surgery was the commonest challenge reported by 37.6% (53/141) of the ESOs.
And, “absence or unsatisfactory duty payment and incentive” was the second commonest challenge reported by 35.5% (33/141).
Majority of the ESOs, 68.7% (92/134), expressed their intent to continue working in their current facilities in the year after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally the deployment of ESOs in all health facilities (Primary and General Hospitals) has resulted in remarkable increase in volume of MNH and emergency surgical services with improvement in maternal and perinatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key conclusions and recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row row-center brdr&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortage of equipment and supplies related to surgery, and absence or unsatisfactory duty payment and incentives were the main challenges reported by the ESOs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; The main challenges reported by the ESOs should be discussed and addressed by the stake holders and respective facilities so as to maintain the achievement gained so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row row-center brdr&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-deployment assessment and filling of identified gaps was not done in many of the facilities.
The deployment of ESOs in all facilities has led to significant increase in volume of MNH and emergency surgical services compared to the year prior to their deployment.
The increase in ESO only facilities especially was more significant compared to ESO plus facilities which is commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-deployment assessment of all facilities need to be done at all times to optimally utilize and maintain ESOs’ clinical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row row-center brdr&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reduction in proportion of intra-facility maternal deaths by more than a third was a good achievement.
Excessive blood loss and deep incision extension were the commonest documented complications in cases being managed by the ESOs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col col-50&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; To further reduce proportion of intra-facility maternal deaths and improve maternal and perinatal outcomes, factors leading to delay in reaching the facilities need to be assessed and addressed accordingly.
As the most common complications are excessive blood loss, deep incision extension and wound infection, focused surgical skill building support/mentoring should be considered by the stake holders of the IESO programme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
