title: The Clinical Performance of Emergency Surgical Officers in Southern Ethiopia
---

##### Background

Serious shortage of gynecologists and surgeons for several decades leading to a threeyear
masters level training was initiated in 2009. However, systematic analysis was not done to assess the
graduates’ performance. The purpose of this study was to assess improvement in access to emergency
surgical and obstetrical care services.

##### Methods
Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to assess the competence of
emergency surgical officers (ESOs) in their decision making and surgical skills in eight hospitals
between 2012 and 2014. Anesthesia time, post-operative hospital stay and change in hemoglobin level
were, among others, used as proxy indicators of their surgical skills.

##### Results
A total of 4075 obstetric and surgical operations was performed in the study hospitals. Of
which, 93% were done on emergency base. Of the total emergency procedures, 3570(94%) were done by
ESOs. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of all the emergency operations were cesarean sections, which were done
by ESOs. Out of 239 uterine ruptures, hysterectomy was done for 58%. The proportion of cesarean and
instrumental deliveries over the total deliveries were 13% and 0.7%, respectively. Explorative
laparotomies and appendectomies were the majority of the non-obstetric emergency operations.
Interviewed staff in the respective hospitals stated that ESOs’ clinical decision making, surgical skill and
commitment to discharge their responsibilities were in the best possible.

##### Conclusions 
The study showed that deployment of ESOs made the emergency surgery services
accessible to the majority, and their clinical decision making and surgical skills were remarkable.
