# Readme - IMAGES

Use this folder to store any images that are necessary for the website. 

Make sure the images follow the site guidelines noted below. 

Do not use this folder for other files. Use '/public/docs' instead.

## Guidelines

1. File types: .jpg or .png only
2. File size: Optimise for low bandwith networks. This may include the following optimisations:
    - interlaced
    - progressive 
    - 70-80% quality
    - no more than 600px in maximum dimension
3. Make sure the image adds value to the textual content
4. Avoid low quality images
5. All images must have a 'alt' tag for situations where they have not loaded correctly.
6. Non-loading should fail safely without affecting the appearance of the rest of the web page.
