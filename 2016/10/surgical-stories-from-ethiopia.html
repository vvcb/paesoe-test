The man was stabbed during a violent fight and was left in a state of shock (BP 80/40mmhg and PR 126 bpm). After abdominal examination, it was concluded that he had a 2 cm by 2 cm deep wound on the subumbilical area. There was eviscerated bowel and the area was soiled with fecal content. Fortunately, it was viable (not ischemic).<p>After the diagnosis of the penetrating abdominal trauma, the area 2 degrees to the stab injury was eviscerated. Meanwhile resuscitation and the baseline investigation were sent to the labotatory. The patient was taken to OR and a laparotomy was conducted. The intraoperative finding was a 1 cm by 1cm two site bowel perforation at its mesentdric border. The site of perforations was repaired using two layers and cleaning the peritonium. Haematocrit was 18% so one unit of blood intraoperatively and one unit post operatively was given. IV antibiotic was started after 7 days. The patient finally reached a stable condition and was discharged from hospital.<p><img src="/assets/images/2016-10-25-stories-from-ethiopia-trauma-laparotomy.jpg" alt="Picture of surgeon, assistant and anaesthetist during a trauma laparotomy" /><h3 id="ruptured-uterus-saved-by-non-doctor-surgeons">Ruptured uterus saved by non-doctor surgeons</h3><p>A 34 year-old woman, gravida 5 para 4, was admitted to the hospital after complaining of a pushing down sesnsation.
