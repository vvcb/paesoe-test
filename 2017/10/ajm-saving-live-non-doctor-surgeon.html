The authors concluded that task-sharing with trained non-doctor emergency surgeons can improve access and outcomes for patients in need of essential surgical care.<h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Ethiopia has serious shortages of obstetric and surgical specialists. A national Masters degree programme to train non-doctor mid-level health professionals in Emergency Surgery and Obstetrics started in 2009. Qualified professionals are known as integrated emergency surgical officers (IESOs).<h3 id="aims">Aims</h3><p>This study was carried out to evaluate graduated IESO's performances and the outcome of their work.<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3><p>Questionnaires were sent to all 135 registered members of the Professional Association of Emergency Surgical Officers of Ethiopia (PAESOE). Responses were received from 64 IESOs.<h3 id="findings">Findings</h3><p>Results showed that the IESOs had carried out a total of 20 176 caesarean sections since graduating. In the first 3 months of 2016, there were 3035 caesarean sections and 970 other laparotomies. Following caesarean section, the rate of neonatal deaths was 2.8%, and the rate of maternal deaths was 0.26%. The rate of maternal deaths following laparotomies was 0.61%. The rate of postoperative complications was 1.92%.<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4><p>Results showed that task-sharing with trained non-doctor emergency surgeons can improve access and outcomes for patients in need of essential surgical care. A similar programme could be a model for other developing countries.<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.12968/ajmw.2017.11.4.181"><span class="i-external-link"></span> Online Article</a><p><a href="/assets/docs/saving-lives-by-task-sharing-non-doctor-surgeon-ajm.pdf"><span class="i-download"></span> Fulltext PDF 150kB</a></section><section class="container float-center"><div> <a href="/2017/10/annual-conference-report" title="Annual Conference Report - 2017" class="button button-icon"> <span class="i-chevron-left"></span> </a><progress value="692" max="1000"></progress> <a href="/2017/10/neonatal-resus-training-report" title="Neonatal Resuscitation Training - October 2017" class="button button-icon"> <span class="i-chevron-right"></span> </a></div></section></main><footer> <a class ="button button-icon" href="https://vvcb.github.io/paesoe-test/about" aria-label="Copyright Notice"> <span>&copy;</span> </a> <a class ="button button-icon" href="https://twitter.com/PaesoeOrg" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to PAESOE on @PaesoeOrg"> <span class="i-twitter"></span> </a> <a class ="button button-icon" href="https://www.facebook.com/Professional-association-of-Integrated-emergency-surgical-officers-912482102210807" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to PAESOE on Facebook"> <span class="i-facebook"></span> </a> <a class ="button button-icon" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/paesoe" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to PAESOE on LinkedIn"> <span class="i-linkedin"></span> </a> <a class ="button button-icon" href="https://github.com/paesoe" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to PAESOE on Github"> <span class="i-github"></span> </a></footer></body></html>
