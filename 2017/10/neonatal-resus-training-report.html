They are also responsible to help and coach midwives in resuscitating and evaluating the babies. So boosting their capacity on neonatal resuscitation and newborn evaluation is the paramount important.<p>Understanding this, professional association for emergency surgical officers of Ethiopia in collaboration with UNFPA took the initiative to conduct two days refreshment training for 25 IESOs, held on 28^th^ and 29^th^ of October, 2017 in Embilta Hotel, Addis Ababa.<p>The aim of the training was to equip ESOs with advanced neonatal resuscitation skills using basic equipment and to enhance their knowledge on newborn evaluation before referral to the best set up.<p>The learning objectives of the participants were that;<ul><li>Demonstrate an understanding of the physiology asphyxia<li>Assess the new born at birth<li>Perform resuscitation of new born using basic equipment</ul><h3 id="20-activities">2.0 Activities</h3><p>Activities included;<ul><li>Pre-test<li>Oral Presentations<li>Illustration<li>Return Demonstration<li>Post test<li>Feedback from the participants</ul><h3 id="30-pre-test">3.0 Pre-test</h3><p>The pre – test included basic questions on initial assessment of the new born, immediate care of the new born and resuscitation techniques.
