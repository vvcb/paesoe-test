## Professional Association of Integrated Emergency Surgical Officers of Ethiopia

Welcome to the website of the Professional Association of Integrated Emergency Surgical Officers of Ethiopia. This GitHub repository holds the Jekyll site that is served up by GitHub Pages. 

The development of this website happens at a forked repository owned by https://github.com/vvcb. If you wish to contribute, please get in touch by sending an email to ieso.ethiopia at gmail dot com. 

#### Pointers for collaborators

For current collaborators, these are the simple guidelines regarding workflow.

All development happens at https://github.com/vvcb/vvcb.github.io. 

1. The primary development branches are vvcb-develop and iv. 
2. All commits from collaborators are merged into vvcb-develop for review. 
3. Once this stage is complete, vvcb-develop is merged into master. 
4. This updates the website https://vvcb.github.io and allows testing in the 'real world'.
5. Any errors are fixed on the vvcb-develop branch before being merged back onto master.
6. The final version is then incorporated into paieso.github.io via a pull request updating the 'live' website.
