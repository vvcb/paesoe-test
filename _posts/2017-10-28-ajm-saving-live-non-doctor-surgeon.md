A survey published in the African Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health ([AJM](https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajmw))  showed that IESO's had carried out a total of 20 176 caesarean sections since graduating with low postoperative complications and mortality. 
The authors concluded that task-sharing with trained non-doctor emergency surgeons can improve access and outcomes for patients in need of essential surgical care.

**Abstract**

**Background:**
Ethiopia has serious shortages of obstetric and surgical specialists.
A national Masters degree programme to train non-doctor mid-level health professionals in Emergency Surgery and Obstetrics started in 2009.
Qualified professionals are known as integrated emergency surgical officers (IESOs).

**Aims:**
This study was carried out to evaluate graduated IESO\'s performances and the outcome of their work.

**Methods:**
Questionnaires were sent to all 135 registered members of the Professional Association of Emergency Surgical Officers of Ethiopia (PAESOE).
Responses were received from 64 IESOs.

**Findings:**
Results showed that the IESOs had carried out a total of 20 176 caesarean sections since graduating.
In the first 3 months of 2016, there were 3035 caesarean sections and 970 other laparotomies.
Following caesarean section, the rate of neonatal deaths was 2.8%, and the rate of maternal deaths was 0.26%.
The rate of maternal deaths following laparotomies was 0.61%.
The rate of postoperative complications was 1.92%.

**Conclusions:**
Results showed that task-sharing with trained non-doctor emergency surgeons can improve access and outcomes for patients in need of essential surgical care.
A similar programme could be a model for other developing countries.
