A 29 year-old man was admitted to Sekota hospital on Febuary 2, 2014 after suffering a serious injury. The man was stabbed during a violent fight and was left in a state of shock (BP 80/40mmhg and PR 126 bpm). After abdominal examination, it was concluded that he had a 2 cm by 2 cm deep wound on the subumbilical area. There was eviscerated bowel and the area was soiled with fecal content. Fortunately, it was viable (not ischemic).

After the diagnosis of the penetrating abdominal trauma, the area 2 degrees to the stab injury was eviscerated.  Meanwhile resuscitation and the baseline investigation were sent to the labotatory. The patient was taken to OR and a laparotomy was conducted. The intraoperative finding was a 1 cm by 1cm two site bowel perforation at its mesentdric border (or boarder?). The site of perforations was repaired using two layers and cleaning the peritonium. Haematocrit was 18% so one unit of blood intraoperatively and one unite post operatively was given. IV antibiotic was started after 7 days. The patient finally reached a stable condition and was discharged from hospital.
