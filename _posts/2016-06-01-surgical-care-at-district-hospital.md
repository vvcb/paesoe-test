From the manualâ€¦.

> Surgical Care at the District Hospital provides a comprehensive guide to surgical procedures that are commonly performed at the district hospital. It is intentionally limited to emergency and very common problems and is not designed as a major textbook of surgery.
>
> The manual is presented in seven parts with an initial section on organizing the district surgical service followed by clinical sections which include basic surgical procedures, the abdomen, emergency obstetrics, resuscitation and anaesthesia, acute trauma management and orthopaedics. It concludes with a course manual for teaching primary trauma care.
