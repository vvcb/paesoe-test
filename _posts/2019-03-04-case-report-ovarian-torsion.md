A 35 years old mother, P=V A=0, lactating a one-year old male child, presented to Bele Primary Hospital with a chief complaint of severe and intermittent crampy lower abdominal pain.
She also complained of abdominal swelling, nausea, and constipation.

Under general anaesthesia with endotracheal integration, emergency laparotomy was performed via a vertical midline incision.

A large ovarian cyst had caused left adnexal torsion resulting in a very ischemic left ovary and dark and edematous left adnexa pedicles.
The adnexal mass had twisted anti-clockwise 4 times (4x).
The right adnexa, uterus, bladder and bowel were healthy.

Detorsion or untwisting of the ischemic left ovarian mass and edematous fallopian tube was attempted to check for viability. With no evidence of viability, a left Salpingo-oopherectomy was performed to remove severely ischemic left adnexal torsion.

#### Postoperative Outcome

The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged home after 5 days in the hospital.
