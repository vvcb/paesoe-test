*Primary Surgery is a textbook on surgery, anesthesiology and trauma that is aimed at surgeons  comprising three volumes. It is directed at doctors and medical students without surgical specialty training who have to cope with surgical pathologies and emergencies in a self-reliant way at a district hospital without consultation possibility. With abundant and concise illustration these books offer a practical guidance for general practitioners who practice medicine and surgery with the bare minimum of technical equipment needed. Amongst the extensive content the doctor learns to safely perform standard procedures like the caesarean section, bowel resection and bone fenestration.*

*Primary Surgery also describes rare clinical pictures from all surgical disciplines and their therapy. Beyond the scope of a basic medical textbook the volumes give comprehensive assistance with the organization of a surgical unit and include instructions regarding the set up and manufacturing of provisional installations and devices amongst others using commonplace items.*
